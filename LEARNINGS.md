## What Has Worked

**2026-06-18 — Seed roster/enrollment ingestion**
- Observation: The workbook `raw` sheet yields 76 canonical roster rows and keeps TJHSST as exactly one school row.
- Action: Build canonical school outputs from `raw`; do not add schools from `nsmf 2019` unless independently source-backed and intentionally added to the roster.
- Confidence: high

**2026-06-18 — Public enrollment matching**
- Observation: `Sheet6` contains two `FREEDOM HIGH` rows without district names or NCES IDs, so the seed workbook alone cannot distinguish South Riding from Woodbridge.
- Action: Leave both canonical Freedom High enrollment values blank with `ambiguous_source_name` until an enrollment source with district or NCES identifiers resolves the rows.
- Confidence: high

**2026-06-18 — Rename alias parsing**
- Observation: Roster notes such as `Renamed from George Mason HS in 2021` include date text after the prior school abbreviation.
- Action: Strip trailing date phrases when deriving aliases from rename notes so aliases remain school names, not school-name-plus-year strings.
- Confidence: high

## Patterns and Preferences

**2026-06-18 — Local test invocation**
- Observation: The reliable local test command for this scaffold is `python -m unittest discover -s tests`.
- Action: Use the explicit `-s tests` discovery command in README and verification runs.
- Confidence: high

**2026-06-18 - Hypothesis framing**
- Observation: The project handoff frames the work as a testable right-tail outcome study, not as a direct measurement of culture or a value judgment on TJHSST admissions policy.
- Action: Keep future narrative docs explicit that NMSF is a narrow source-backed signal, and require regional offset tests before making claims from TJHSST-only changes.
- Confidence: high

**2026-06-18 — Source-note preservation**
- Observation: Raw ChatGPT/source-note text files live under `docs/source_notes/` alongside the seed workbook, separate from generated CSV outputs.
- Action: When asked to push everything, preserve these files as source notes rather than folding their contents into canonical data.
- Confidence: high

**2026-06-18 — Repo handoff status review**
- Observation: The current scaffold already has the first-milestone roster/enrollment seed in place, with an empty NMSF source manifest and all 608 panel rows still marked `source_pending`.
- Action: Treat the next major milestone as source-backed NMSF manifest/parsers rather than recreating the repo scaffold or public-enrollment seed outputs.
- Confidence: high

**2026-06-18 - Manual NMSF ingestion**
- Observation: `scripts/apply_nmsf_counts.py` overlays source-backed transcriptions from `data/sources/nmsf_counts.csv` onto `panel_seed.csv`, leaving the seed panel blank and computing source hashes from each source's metadata plus transcribed count rows.
- Action: Add future district or private-school NMSF slices to `data/sources/nmsf_counts.csv` and regenerate `data/interim/panel_nmsf.csv`; do not hand-edit `panel_nmsf.csv` counts directly.
- Confidence: high

**2026-06-18 - Source-note deletion**
- Observation: The exported ChatGPT source-note text files under `docs/source_notes/` were intentionally removed by the user, while the seed workbook remains in place.
- Action: Preserve source notes by default, but stage these specific deletions when publishing this repo state because the user explicitly confirmed them.
- Confidence: high
